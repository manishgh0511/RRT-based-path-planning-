Image processing and path planning techniques to improve autonomous navigation in complex environments. 
Developed a methodology in MATLAB for stereo image processing to create panoramic views, detect obstacles, and generate binary occupancy maps, utilizing techniques such as Gaussian smoothing, the SURF algorithm, and Laplacian filters.
Evaluated multiple variants of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, including RRT star, Informed RRT star, and Quick RRT star, algorithms to enhance path planning efficiency.
